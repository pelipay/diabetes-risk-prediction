# Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict diabetes risk based on diverse health, lifestyle, and demographic factors. The project includes data analysis, model development, and evaluation using various machine learning algorithms.

## Overview
In this project, we used various health data to predict the likelihood of diabetes onset using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of different classifiers to predict diabetes.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and more.
